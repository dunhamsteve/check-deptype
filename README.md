This repository contains what I wrote while working through "Checking Dependent Types with Normalization by Evaluation: A Tutorial (Haskell Version)" by David Thrane Christiansen.  A good chunk of the work was done back in January when I was just learning Idris. This readme was written much later.

It looks like I organized things: 

- `src/Main2.idr` Material for Section 1, with a parser appended.
- `src/Main3.idr` Includes the changes in section 3
- `src/Main4.idr` Includes the changes in section 4
- `src/Main5.idr` Includes the changes from section 5
- `src/Tartlet.idr` Includes section 6 and the beginnings of a REPL

2022-11 - Tartlet had be set aside and REPL code was half-written.  It is in place now, but there is a subtle issue and I need a bunch of Show implementations to debug.
